* Advent of Code 2019

I started this year's Advent of Code pretty late. I was reading through some of the problems and found out that this year's problem involves an implementation of a simple virtual machine, which is one of my favorite topics in computer science. So this year, I'm going to build an [Intcode](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/5) VM and a simple compiler against it and solve AoC problems on top of it.

Before I started solving the first day's puzzle, I first implemented a very basic version of Intcode VM described in Day 2 and Day 5. I might need to add more opcodes not included in the described spec in the puzzles, if something is impossible to implement on top of the VM.

You can build the VM by running `make`.
